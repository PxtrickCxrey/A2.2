My A2.2 Web development project.

A copy of my A2.2 report: 1. What was the learning goal?
The learning goal of my exercise was to learn how to develop a web program. I have never used html, javascript etc., so this was a big task for me to learn, but I also wanted to learn this for future projects and classes so I chose a difficult challenge on the website I used to help guide me through this assignment.

3. What was accomplished?
In my website, I created a fully functioning rock paper scissors game. First things first, I created the file style.css, and inside this I went through styling the website ranging from importing a font, to styling the gradients of the background and the buttons, the score and the title etc. Then we had to code the rules of the game, such as “rock beats scissors” etc. and for each time you beat the random ai, you gain a +1, for each draw +0, and for each loss -1 to your score. This is the first time that I have ever created something like this although I had a lot of support from the tutorials but now I feel a lot more comfortable with web development and hopefully in the future I need a lot less support with this style of coding.
4. What was challenging?
The most challenging part of this, as previously stated, is that I have never code in this style before. However, the support of the tutorial was useful. I also had a lot of struggle setting it up and had to use stackoverflow a lot in order to help with the setup.
